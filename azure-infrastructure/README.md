# Azure Terraform Infrastructure for On-Prem

This repository contains the Terraform configuration files for setting up the On-Prem infrastructure on Azure.

## Prerequisites

Before running this code, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Azure Service Principal credentials
- Terraform 1.8.3
- Azure CLI

## Local Environment Setup

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. **Install Azure CLI**: Make sure you have the Azure CLI installed on your local machine.
2. **Initialize Azure CLI with credentials**: Authenticate the Azure CLI with your Azure credentials.

## Configuration Variables (`dev.tfvars`)

Here's a brief description of the variables in the `dev.tfvars` file:

- `admin_username`: The username for the Azure admin account.
- `admin_ssh_key`: The path to the public SSH key for the Azure admin account.
- `registry_name`: The name of the Azure Container Registry (ACR).
- `pg_server_name`: The name of the PostgreSQL server.
- `pg_databases`: A list of databases to be created on the PostgreSQL server.
- `storage_account_name`: The name of the Azure Storage Account.
- `dns_zone_name`: The name of the Azure DNS Zone.
- `public_ip_name`: The name of the public IP address.
- `lb_name`: The name of the Load Balancer.

## How to Use

1. Update the `dev.tfvars` file with your specific configuration values.
2. Run `terraform init -backend-config='dev.config' `.
3. Run `terraform plan -var-file=dev.tfvars` to see the changes that will be made.
4. Run `terraform apply -var-file=dev.tfvars` to apply the changes.

Please ensure you have the necessary permissions and the Azure CLI installed and configured before running these commands.

## CI/CD

All changes are applied in the CI. On EVERY Pull Request, the version should be bumped (patch if no other changes are required).

- **On a PR**: `init` & `plan` are run on CI without `apply`.
- **On merge of PR to main**: `init`, `plan` & `apply` are run on Insait's Azure subscription (dev).
